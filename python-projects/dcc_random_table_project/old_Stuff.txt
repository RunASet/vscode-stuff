The Following are previous methods and functions that I used, saving them here if the new code I've added ruins the stuff I have made already.

1. The following is a function that could make the if else statement chains reduntdant need to find a way to make it return a integer for the dictionary
##
#   function: print_random_event(int)
#
#   Input: integer representing the players choice of table
#
#   variables: integer data type, n == Holds players choice
#
#   return: no return
#
#   purpose: Perform while loop that will let the player keep rolling on a same table if they choose too, will grab the table

def print_random_event(n):
    i = 1
    while i == 1:
        print(n["name"], random.randint(1, n["table_size"]))
        if roll_Again() == 0:
            break

2. The following is a method that allows us to grab select which table we want using a dictionary than the other method

def travel_events():
        print("\n-------------------------------------\n"," Travel Event Tables\n", "\b-------------------------------------\n")
        n = int(input("Where are you travelling?\n\n"
                  "(1) Desert\n"
                  "(2) Ocean\n"
                  "(3) Mountain\n"
                  "(4) Random\n"
                  "Select (1-4): "))
        event = Events._TRAVEL_EVENTS.get(n)
        if event:
            print_random_event(event)
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please select a number between 1 and 4.")

3. The following is a Attribute that represents a dictionary that holds the value of all the possible tables we might roll wit
_TRAVEL_EVENTS = {
    1: {"name": "Desert", "table_size": 500},
    2: {"name": "Ocean", "table_size": 500},
    3: {"name": "Mountain", "table_size": 500},
    4: {"name": "Random", "table_size": 500},
}
